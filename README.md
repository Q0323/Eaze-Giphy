### How do I get set up? ###

* pod install

### Important Notes ###

* I have added GIPHY's API KEY from this repo (I don't usually push Keys/sensitive data to repos), making it easier to build and run
* Amidst all my assignments I tried to find as much time as possible and instead of taking 4-5 days, I have done whatever I could in 10-12 hours (with dinner and sleep breaks, of course)
