### How do you get set up? ###

* pod install

### Important Notes ###

* I have added GIPHY's API KEY in this repo (I usually don't push Keys/sensitive data to repos), making it easier to build and run
* Amidst all my academic assignments I tried to find as much time as possible to work on it. Instead of taking 4-5 days, I have done whatever I could in 10-12 hours (with dinner and sleep breaks, of course)

### To Do ###
* Adding a few more UI improvements and components
